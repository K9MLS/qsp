# Changelog

All notable changes to QSP. Dates are UTC.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **First staticcheck run.** `S1011` in `internal/peers/fuzz_test.go` — a copy
  loop replaced with a variadic append.
- CI actions bumped to `checkout@v5` and `setup-go@v6`. Node.js 20 is removed
  from GitHub runners in September 2026, so the previous versions were on a
  deadline rather than merely deprecated.
- `cache: false` in every CI job. `setup-go` keys its cache on `go.sum`, which
  a zero-dependency module does not have, so every job logged a cache-restore
  failure for a cache that would have been empty.

### Not changed
- **`S1016` in `internal/peers/master.go` is suppressed with a reason.**
  staticcheck suggests converting `Ping` to `Pong` rather than naming the field.
  The two are distinct wire messages that share a shape by coincidence; a
  conversion would silently copy any field later added to both. See the comment
  at the call site. The response message is now hoisted to a local so the
  `//lint:ignore` directive sits on the line it suppresses — the directive
  applies to the following line only, and inside a composite literal that is not
  where the diagnostic lands.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-08-25

Documentation regenerated against the code it describes.

### Changed
- **`PROJECT_MEMORY.md` regenerated.** It described 289 tests, 12 commits and a
  seven-subsystem health report, and listed hardware validation without noting
  that the Phase 1 gate it was meant to satisfy remains open.
- **Phase-gate status is now stated explicitly**, in `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` §2 and
  §6. BLUEPRINT §16 requires hardware validation at every gate; the 2026-08-23
  session confirmed registration and keepalives but no voice frame ever reached
  QSP, so Phase 1 is code-complete and gate-open. Recording a passing test suite
  as though it were a gate is the same class of error as stale prose.
- Three gaps added to the known-gaps table that were true but unwritten: no
  authentication on any endpoint, the accuracy gate's blindness to over-claiming,
  and `overall: healthy` while ten of eleven subsystems are unavailable.
- Working conventions now record that documentation accuracy is a CI gate, and
  that two different trees must never carry the same version.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-08-24

Documentation accuracy becomes a gate rather than a habit.

### Added
- **Documentation accuracy is now a CI gate.** `cmd/qsp/docaccuracy_test.go`
  checks documented endpoints against the registered routes, paths named in
  prose against the filesystem, emptiness claims against directory contents, and
  absence claims against the health registry. Every documentation defect found
  in this project so far fails at least one of these checks. Escape hatches
  require a written reason; see `docs/architecture/testing.md`.
- **P25, AllStar, Zello and EchoLink now register health checks.** Constitution
  §3 requires an absent subsystem to report its absence, and four of them were
  reporting nothing at all — `/healthz` was silent about most of the roadmap
  while `README.md` and `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` both claimed each reported
  `unavailable`.

### Fixed
- **Seven places described a build that no longer existed.** 0.1.1 fixed this in
  the console; the same stale prose survived in `cmd/qsp/main.go` and
  `internal/protocol/doc.go` (both package docs, so `go doc` printed them),
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 — which contradicted itself on the peer lifecycle within
  one paragraph — and `docs/architecture/testing.md`, which called the `testdata`
  directories empty while three captures sat committed beside it.
- **`GET /api/peers` was missing from two endpoint inventories**, in
  `SECURITY.md` and in the text an operator sees when no console is embedded. It
  returns callsigns, radio IDs and source addresses, so its absence from the
  security inventory understated what an exposed instance discloses.
- A broken reference to the SQLite driver ADR in `README.md`, found by the new
  path check.

### Changed
- **API routes are declared once**, in `server.apiRoutes`. The handler registers
  from that list and `handleNoConsole` reports from it, so the operator-facing
  endpoint list can no longer fall behind the routes actually served.
- `BLUEPRINT.md` is marked as frozen at v0.4 and no longer reads as a
  description of the current build.
- `staticcheck` is pinned in CI rather than tracking `@latest`, so an upstream
  release cannot fail a commit that changed nothing.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-23

First build validated against real hardware.

### Added
- **PTT-triggered bridging.** A bridge opens when somebody transmits on a
  declared endpoint and closes after a hang time. With the scheduler, this
  completes the feature the blueprint names as QSP's reason to exist.
- **Traffic counters on the console.** During hardware testing `/healthz`
  diagnosed in one request what the console could not show at all.
- Canonical GPL-3.0 licence text and a separate `COPYRIGHT` notice.
- `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`.

### Fixed
- **Shutdown hung for 15 seconds with a console tab open.** `Shutdown` waits for
  active connections but does not cancel their request contexts, so a streaming
  handler never returned. Found by an operator on the first real run.
- **The console described a build that no longer existed**, claiming no
  protocol, routing or scheduling code was present.
- **Health summaries quoted the phase plan** rather than the running instance.
- Peer addresses displayed as IPv4-mapped IPv6.

### Validated
- A WPSD hotspot completed the login handshake, registered, and held its session
  with keepalives cycling. Confirmed the auth construction, the `RPTC` field
  offsets, and the keepalive direction chosen against the specification.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-23

Initial development build: foundation, HBP codec, peer lifecycle, UDP listener,
call observation, routing, scheduler. 16 ADRs. Zero dependencies.
